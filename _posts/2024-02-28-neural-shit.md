## The Neural Map

Our sense of navigation is not something we tend to consider too deeply in our day-to-day lives. Nevertheless, we somehow have a subconscious knowledge of were we are in the world and where we are going. We use it everywhere - to walk home, to go to the grocery store, to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night. 

How we navigate is largely dependent on what information is available to us. The brain is complex and uses a variety of strategies to determine our position, relative to other landmarks and to start or goal locations. Among those is beaconing, a strategy where we use a distant object to navigate to - say, “Hey, there’s a neon sign here saying ‘Pub’” - that’s probably the entrance to the pub. But what if you don’t have those clues? 

This is where path integration comes in.

## Path Integration

Say you're out on a hike with your friends. You’re full of energy during the day and make plenty of detours before you get to the campsite and settle in for a restful night, listening to the soothing patter of rain on the tent.
Oh no! It's 2am and you're woken up in what an optimist would call a 'puddle', and anyone else might label 'a decidedly sizable body of water'.

*So much for the guy on Facebook Marketplace promising that the tent was waterproof.*

You and your friend make the decision to trek back to the car park. You wish one of you had brought a headlamp at least - you can't use any landmarks to navigate. Despite that, you somehow manage to make it back in one piece, going straight from the campsite to the carpark without any of the diversions you had undertaken on the way there. *How?*

**INSERT PHASER GAME**

Two types of sensory information are required to update where we think we are: *Allothetic information* we get from the outside environment, like that ‘Pub’ sign. *Idiothetic information* is generated by the body itself. For example, the brain signals responsible for walking to the pub also provide us with information about how far we’ve walked so far. Path integration uses these idiothetic cues to transverse the mental map in our head. For example, a mouse that is foraging and takes a long, winding trajectory towards its goal will have ‘calculated’ its displacement from its nest and can make a beeline safely back if it suddenly runs into a fox.


  {% include figure.liquid path="../../assets/img/images/mouse_integration.png" alt="mouse integration" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Studying path integration is
      complicated by the fact that it’s only one part of the mechanism behind navigation. It’s an error-prone system,
      and so it works in combination with other information to create a path - for example, a mouse might use remembered
      landmarks, olfaction and even way-marking to navigate through an environment. Studying the neurons specifically
      involved in path integration therefore requires us to remove all other possibilities but using path integration.
      How do we do *that?*


  {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/pi_exp_1.png" alt="pi 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

 One way of studying path integration is using virtual reality. Mice run through a VR corridor on a treadmill until
    there’s a visual cue. If they stop at the visual cue, they get a treat. After a few repetitions, the visual cue is
    removed - yet the mice still stop in the place where the visual cue *would have been*. If there are no external cues for
    the mice to see, how do they know when to stop?
    
  The mice can’t use other navigational strategies, such as beaconing, because there’s no allothetic cues, so they’re left with path integration. They might have remembered the time it took to run to the reward zone - but when the speed of the treadmill was changed, the mice didn’t overshoot the reward zone, despite running faster. This implies they weren’t measuring the time, but were instead getting their information from a collection of self-motion cues. This includes proprioception (the sense of your self-position and self-movement) along with the vestibular system (your inner ear, which provides a sense of balance and awareness of our head and body in
  space) and motor efference. Over longer distances, the accuracy of this system drops without external input such as landmarks, as small errors start to accumulate and the mice start to stop further away from the reward zone. 

    <div class="l-page">
  {% include figure.liquid path="../assets/img/images/pi_exp_2.png" alt="pi 1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}</div>>

## Cell types

  Path integration is just one of the many navigational strategies we want to study to understand the basis of the neural map. There are many specialised cell types involved in navigation. For the purpose of this website, let’s focus on three: place cells, grid cells, and head direction cells.

  {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/images/cell_types.png" alt="cell types" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}</div>

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

---

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
return x \* x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
df,
lat='Latitude',
lon='Longitude',
z='Magnitude',
radius=10,
center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
zoom=0,
mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

---

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
